abstract: Recently, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been discovered with novel functions,
  and it has been appreciated that there is pervasive transcription of genomes. Moreover,
  many novel ncRNAs are not conserved on the primary sequence level. Therefore, de
  novo computational ncRNA detection that is accurate and efficient is desirable.
  The purpose of this study is to develop a ncRNA detection method based on conservation
  of structure in more than two genomes. A new method called Multifind, using Multilign,
  was developed. Multilign predicts the common secondary structure for multiple input
  sequences. Multifind then uses measures of structure conservation to estimate the
  probability that the input sequences are a conserved ncRNA using a classification
  support vector machine. Multilign is based on Dynalign, which folds and aligns two
  sequences simultaneously using a scoring scheme that does not include sequence identity;
  its structure prediction quality is therefore not affected by input sequence diversity.
  Additionally, ensemble defect was introduced to Multifind as an additional discriminating
  feature that quantifies the compactness of the folding space for a sequence. Benchmarks
  showed Multifind performs better than RNAz and LocARNATE+RNAz, a method that uses
  RNAz on structure alignments generated by LocARNATE, on testing sequences extracted
  from the Rfam database. For de novo ncRNA discovery in three genomes, Multifind
  and LocARNATE+RNAz had an advantage over RNAz in low similarity regions of genome
  alignments. Additionally, Multifind and LocARNATE+RNAz found different subsets of
  known ncRNA sequences, suggesting the two approaches are complementary.
