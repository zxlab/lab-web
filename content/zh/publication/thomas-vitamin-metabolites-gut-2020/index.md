abstract: The vitamin D receptor is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract
  where it transacts gene expression. With current limited understanding of the interactions
  between the gut microbiome and vitamin D, we conduct a cross-sectional analysis
  of 567 older men quantifying serum vitamin D metabolites using LC-MSMS and defining
  stool sub-Operational Taxonomic Units from16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing data.
  Faith's Phylogenetic Diversity and non-redundant covariate analyses reveal that
  the serum 1,25(OH)2D level explains 5% of variance in $α$-diversity. In $β$-diversity
  analyses using unweighted UniFrac, 1,25(OH)2D is the strongest factor assessed,
  explaining 2% of variance. Random forest analyses identify 12 taxa, 11 in the phylum
  Firmicutes, eight of which are positively associated with either 1,25(OH)2D and/or
  the hormone-to-prohormone [1,25(OH)2D/25(OH)D] ``activation ratio.'' Men with higher
  levels of 1,25(OH)2D and higher activation ratios, but not 25(OH)D itself, are more
  likely to possess butyrate producing bacteria that are associated with better gut
  microbial health.
