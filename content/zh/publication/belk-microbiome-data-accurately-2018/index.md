abstract: Death investigations often include an effort to establish the postmortem
  interval (PMI) in cases in which the time of death is uncertain. The postmortem
  interval can lead to the identification of the deceased and the validation of witness
  statements and suspect alibis. Recent research has demonstrated that microbes provide
  an accurate clock that starts at death and relies on ecological change in the microbial
  communities that normally inhabit a body and its surrounding environment. Here,
  we explore how to build the most robust Random Forest regression models for prediction
  of PMI by testing models built on different sample types (gravesoil, skin of the
  torso, skin of the head), gene markers (16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), 18S rRNA, internal
  transcribed spacer regions (ITS)), and taxonomic levels (sequence variants, species,
  genus, etc.). We also tested whether particular suites of indicator microbes were
  informative across different datasets. Generally, results indicate that the most
  accurate models for predicting PMI were built using gravesoil and skin data using
  the 16S rRNA genetic marker at the taxonomic level of phyla. Additionally, several
  phyla consistently contributed highly to model accuracy and may be candidate indicators
  of PMI.
