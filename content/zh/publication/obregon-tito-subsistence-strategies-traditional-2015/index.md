abstract: Recent studies suggest that gut microbiomes of urban-industrialized societies
  are different from those of traditional peoples. Here we examine the relationship
  between lifeways and gut microbiota through taxonomic and functional potential characterization
  of faecal samples from hunter-gatherer and traditional agriculturalist communities
  in Peru and an urban-industrialized community from the US. We find that in addition
  to taxonomic and metabolic differences between urban and traditional lifestyles,
  hunter-gatherers form a distinct sub-group among traditional peoples. As observed
  in previous studies, we find that Treponema are characteristic of traditional gut
  microbiomes. Moreover, through genome reconstruction (2.2– 2.5 MB, coverage depth
  × 26– 513) and functional potential characterization, we discover these Treponema
  are diverse, fall outside of pathogenic clades and are similar to Treponema succinifaciens,
  a known carbohydrate metabolizer in swine. Gut Treponema are found in non-human
  primates and all traditional peoples studied to date, suggesting they are symbionts
  lost in urban-industrialized societies.
