abstract: In bacteria, sulfur metabolism is regulated in part by seven known families
  of riboswitches that bind S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM). Direct binding of SAM to
  these mRNA regulatory elements governs a downstream secondary structural switch
  that communicates with the transcriptional and/or translational expression machinery.
  The most widely distributed SAM-binding riboswitches belong to the SAM clan, comprising
  three families that share a common SAM-binding core but differ radically in their
  peripheral architecture. Although the structure of the SAM-I member of this clan
  has been extensively studied, how the alternative peripheral architecture of the
  other families supports the common SAM-binding core remains unknown. We have therefore
  solved the X-ray structure of a member of the SAM-I/IV family containing the alternative
  ``PK-2'' subdomain shared with the SAM-IV family. This structure reveals that this
  subdomain forms extensive interactions with the helix housing the SAM-binding pocket,
  including a highly unusual mode of helix packing in which two helices pack in a
  perpendicular fashion. Biochemical and genetic analysis of this RNA reveals that
  SAM binding induces many of these interactions, including stabilization of a pseudoknot
  that is part of the regulatory switch. Despite strong structural similarity between
  the cores of SAM-I and SAM-I/IV members, a phylogenetic analysis of sequences does
  not indicate that they derive from a common ancestor.
