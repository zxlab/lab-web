abstract: Germ-free models and bacterial transplantation technology facilitate the
  mechanism study of the host-gut microbe interaction. Among them, zebrafish is an
  economical and practical model with its characteristics, such as transparent larva
  and efficient gene manipulation, differing from the mouse. Here we enumerate the
  similarities and differences of the genes, the digestive tract structure and the
  gut microbiota of zebrafish and humans. And the recent reports on colonizing human
  gut microbes to zebrafish are elaborated. We summarize the advantages and limitations
  of this model and revalidate those with some important discoveries on the utilization
  of zebrafish in modeling human gut microbe research. This review will make the readers
  clear the advances in the application of zebrafish in gut microbiota-related researches.
