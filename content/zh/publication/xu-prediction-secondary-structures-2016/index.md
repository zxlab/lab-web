abstract: RNA structure is conserved by evolution to a greater extent than sequence.
  Predicting the conserved structure for multiple homologous sequences can be much
  more accurate than predicting the structure for a single sequence. RNAstructure
  is a software package that includes the programs Dynalign, Multilign, TurboFold,
  and PARTS for predicting conserved RNA secondary structure. This chapter provides
  protocols for using these programs.
