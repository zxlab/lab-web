abstract: 'The role of the human microbiome is the subject of continued investigation
  resulting in increased understanding. However, current microbiome research has only
  scratched the surface of the variety of healthy microbiomes. Public participation
  in science through crowdsourcing and crowdfunding microbiome research provides a
  novel opportunity for both participants and investigators. However, turning participatory
  science into publishable data can be challenging. Clear communication with the participant
  base and among researchers can ameliorate some challenges. Three major aspects need
  to be considered: recruitment and ongoing interaction, sample collection, and data
  analysis. Usable data can be maximized through diligent participant interaction,
  careful survey design, and maintaining an open source pipeline. While participatory
  science will complement rather than replace traditional avenues, it presents new
  opportunities for studies in the microbiome and beyond.'
