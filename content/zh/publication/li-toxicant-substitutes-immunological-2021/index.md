abstract: Recurring mycotoxins contamination has posedaseriousthreatto food safety
  worldwide. Competitive immunoassays are widely used techniques for high-throughput
  mycotoxins detection in agricultural products and foods. However, the inevitable
  introduction of mycotoxin conjugates produced by chemical conjugation usually results
  in complicated by-products, large batch errors and threats to operators and environment.
  Biologically derived surrogates of mycotoxin conjugates or mycotoxin standards are
  renewable immunoreagents. They can serve the same function as the responding counterparts
  in the immunoassays. The substitute-based immunoassays exhibit satisfactory sensitivity,
  pose less health threats to operators and environment, and contribute to the standardization
  of immunoassays for mycotoxins. This review focuses on the current applications
  of substitute-based immunoassays, clarifies their underlying mechanisms and provides
  a careful comparison. Challenges and future prospects are discussed.
