abstract: Certain antimicrobial preservatives (APs) have been shown to perturb gut
  microbiota. So far, it is not yet fully known that whether similar effects are observable
  for a more diverse set of APs. It also remains elusive if biogenic APs are superior
  to synthetic APs in terms of safety. To help fill these knowledge gaps, the effects
  of eleven commonly used synthetic and biogenic APs on the gut microbiota and glucose
  metabolism were evaluated in the wild-type healthy mice. Here, we found that APs
  induced glucose intolerance and perturbed gut microbiota, irrespective of their
  origin. In addition, biogenic APs are not always safer than synthetic ones. The
  biogenic AP nisin unexpectedly induced the most significant effects, which might
  be partially mediated by glucagon-like peptide 1 related glucoregulatory hormones
  secretion perturbation.
