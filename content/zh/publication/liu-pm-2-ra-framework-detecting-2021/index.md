abstract: The dysbiosis of gut microbiota is associated with the pathogenesis of human
  disease. However, observing shifts in the microbe abundance cannot fully reveal
  underlying perturbations. Examining the relationship alteration (RA) in the microbiome
  between health status provides additional hints about the pathogenesis of human
  disease, but no methods were designed to detect and quantify the RA between different
  conditions directly. Here, we present Profile Monitoring for Microbial Relationship
  Alteration (PM2RA), an analysis framework to identify and quantify the microbial
  RAs. The performance of PM2RA was evaluated with synthetic data, and showed higher
  specificity and sensitivity than the co-occurrence-based methods. Analyses of real
  microbial datasets showed that PM2RA was robust for quantifying microbial RA across
  different datasets in several diseases. By applying PM2RA, we identified several
  novel or previously reported microbes implicated in multiple diseases. PM2RA is
  now implemented as a web-based application available at http://www.pm2ra-xingyinliulab.cn/.
