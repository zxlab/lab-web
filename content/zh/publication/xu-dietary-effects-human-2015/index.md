abstract: The human gut harbours diverse and abundant microbes, forming a complex
  ecological system that interacts with host and environmental factors. In this article,
  we summarise recent advances in microbiome studies across both Western and non-Western
  populations, either in cross-sectional or longitudinal surveys, and over various
  age groups, revealing a considerable diversity and variability in the human gut
  microbiome. Of all the exogenous factors affecting gut microbiome, a long-term diet
  appears to have the largest effect to date. Recent research on the effects of dietary
  interventions has shown that the gut microbiome can change dramatically with diet;
  however, the gut microbiome is generally resilient, and short-term dietary intervention
  is not typically successful in treating obesity and malnutrition. Understanding
  the dynamics of the gut microbiome under different conditions will help us diagnose
  and treat many diseases that are now known to be associated with microbial communities.
