abstract: We read with interest the work by Pascal et al published recently in Gut
  .1 Here, they report the volatile microbial signatures of patients with Crohn's
  disease (CD), a quality that greatly hinders our ability to classify healthy from
  affected subjects using 16S rRNA profiles from stool. Nonetheless, their work overcame
  these and other complications,2 producing a decision tree that classifies subjects
  with CD, UC, irritable bowel syndrome and anorexia. Although the authors note that
  both subtypes of IBD, particularly CD, have increased microbial community instability,
  this information is not used as a feature to improve classifier accuracy. Could
  microbiome instability become actionable by creating a new classifier that benefits
  from repeated measurements? If so, how many samples per individual are needed to
  assess instability? We collected daily stool samples for up to 6,weeks from 19 CD
  subjects and 12 controls (see the analysis notebook for cohort description, methods
  and data, https://github.com/knightlab-analyses/longitudinal-ibd) over two separate
  periods of 2 or 4 weeks spread over 2 and 5 months, for a total of 960 samples.
