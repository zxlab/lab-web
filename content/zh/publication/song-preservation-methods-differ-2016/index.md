abstract: Immediate freezing at -20° C or below has been considered the gold standard
  for microbiome preservation, yet this approach is not feasible for many field studies,
  ranging from anthropology to wildlife conservation. Here we tested five methods
  for preserving human and dog fecal specimens for periods of up to 8 weeks, including
  such types of variation as freeze-thaw cycles and the high temperature fluctuations
  often encountered under field conditions. We found that three of the methods— 95%
  ethanol, FTA cards, and the OMNIgene Gut kit— can preserve samples sufficiently
  well at ambient temperatures such that differences at 8 weeks are comparable to
  differences among technical replicates. However, even the worst methods, including
  those with no fixative, were able to reveal microbiome differences between species
  at 8 weeks and between individuals after a week, allowing meta-analyses of samples
  collected using various methods when the effect of interest is expected to be larger
  than interindividual variation (although use of a single method within a study is
  strongly recommended to reduce batch effects). Encouragingly for FTA cards, the
  differences caused by this method are systematic and can be detrended. As in other
  studies, we strongly caution against the use of 70% ethanol. The results, spanning
  15 individuals and over 1,200 samples, provide our most comprehensive view to date
  of storage effects on stool and provide a paradigm for the future studies of other
  sample types that will be required to provide a global view of microbial diversity
  and its interaction among humans, animals, and the environment. IMPORTANCE Our study,
  spanning 15 individuals and over 1,200 samples, provides our most comprehensive
  view to date of storage and stabilization effects on stool. We tested five methods
  for preserving human and dog fecal specimens for periods of up to 8 weeks, including
  the types of variation often encountered under field conditions, such as freeze-thaw
  cycles and high temperature fluctuations. We show that several cost-effective methods
  provide excellent microbiome stability out to 8 weeks, opening up a range of field
  studies with humans and wildlife that would otherwise be cost-prohibitive.
