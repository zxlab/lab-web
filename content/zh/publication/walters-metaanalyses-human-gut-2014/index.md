abstract: Recent studies have linked human gut microbes to obesity and inflammatory
  bowel disease, but consistent signals have been difficult to identify. Here we test
  for indicator taxa and general features of the microbiota that are generally consistent
  across studies of obesity and of IBD, focusing on studies involving high-throughput
  sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (which we could process using a common computational
  pipeline). We find that IBD has a consistent signature across studies and allows
  high classification accuracy of IBD from non-IBD subjects, but that although subjects
  can be classified as lean or obese within each individual study with statistically
  significant accuracy, consistent with the ability of the microbiota to experimentally
  transfer this phenotype, signatures of obesity are not consistent between studies
  even when the data are analyzed with consistent methods. The results suggest that
  correlations between microbes and clinical conditions with different effect sizes
  (e.g. the large effect size of IBD versus the small effect size of obesity) may
  require different cohort selection and analysis strategies.
