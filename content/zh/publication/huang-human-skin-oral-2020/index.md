abstract: Human gut microbiomes are known to change with age, yet the relative value
  of human microbiomes across the body as predictors of age, and prediction robustness
  across populations is unknown. In this study, we tested the ability of the oral,
  gut, and skin (hand and forehead) microbiomes to predict age in adults using random
  forest regression on data combined from multiple publicly available studies, evaluating
  the models in each cohort individually. Intriguingly, the skin microbiome provides
  the best prediction of age (mean $±$ standard deviation, 3.8 $±$ 0.45 years, versus
  4.5 $±$ 0.14 years for the oral microbiome and 11.5 $±$ 0.12 years for the gut microbiome).
  This also agrees with forensic studies showing that the skin microbiome predicts
  postmortem interval better than microbiomes from other body sites. Age prediction
  models constructed from the hand microbiome generalized to the forehead and vice
  versa, across cohorts, and results from the gut microbiome generalized across multiple
  cohorts (United States, United Kingdom, and China). Interestingly, taxa enriched
  in young individuals (18 to 30 years) tend to be more abundant and more prevalent
  than taxa enriched in elderly individuals ($>$60 yrs), suggesting a model in which
  physiological aging occurs concomitantly with the loss of key taxa over a lifetime,
  enabling potential microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies to prevent aging.
  IMPORTANCE Considerable evidence suggests that the gut microbiome changes with age
  or even accelerates aging in adults. Whether the age-related changes in the gut
  microbiome are more or less prominent than those for other body sites and whether
  predictions can be made about a person's age from a microbiome sample remain unknown.
  We therefore combined several large studies from different countries to determine
  which body site's microbiome could most accurately predict age. We found that the
  skin was the best, on average yielding predictions within 4 years of chronological
  age. This study sets the stage for future research on the role of the microbiome
  in accelerating or decelerating the aging process and in the susceptibility for
  age-related diseases.
