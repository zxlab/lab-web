abstract: $β$-glucan is a prebiotic well known for its beneficial outcomes on sea
  cucumber health through modifying the host intestinal microbiota. High-throughput
  sequencing techniques provide an opportunity for the identification and characterization
  of microbes. In this study, we investigated the intestinal microbial community composition,
  interaction among species, and intestinal immune genes in sea cucumber fed with
  diet supplemented with or without $β$-glucan supplementation. The results show that
  the intestinal dominant classes in the control group are Flavobacteriia, Gammaproteobacteria,
  and Alphaproteobacteria, whereas Alphaproteobacteria, Flavobacteriia, and Verrucomicrobiae
  are enriched in the $β$-glucan group. Dietary $β$-glucan supplementation promoted
  the proliferation of the family Rhodobacteraceae of the Alphaproteobacteria class
  and the family Verrucomicrobiaceae of the Verrucomicrobiae class and reduced the
  relative abundance of the family Flavobacteriaceae of Flavobacteria class. The ecological
  network analysis suggests that dietary $β$-glucan supplementation can alter the
  network interactions among different microbial functional groups by changing the
  microbial community composition and topological roles of the OTUs in the ecological
  network. Dietary $β$-glucan supplementation has a positive impact on immune responses
  of the intestine of sea cucumber by activating NF-$ąppa$B signaling pathway, probably
  through modulating the balance of intestinal microbiota.
