abstract: Our understanding of the interaction between the gut microbiota and host
  health has recently improved dramatically. However, the effects of toxic metal exposure
  on the gut microbiota remain poorly characterized. As this microbiota creates a
  critical interface between the external environment and the host's cells, it may
  play an important role in host outcomes during exposure. We therefore used 16S ribosomal
  RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing to track changes in the gut microbiota composition of
  rats exposed to heavy metals. Rats were exposed daily for five days to arsenic,
  cadmium, cobalt, chromium, nickel, or a vehicle control. Significant changes to
  microbiota composition were observed in response to high doses of chromium and cobalt,
  and significant dose-dependent changes were observed in response to arsenic, cadmium
  and nickel. Many of these perturbations were not uniform across metals. However,
  bacteria with higher numbers of iron-importing gene orthologs were overly represented
  after exposure to arsenic and nickel, suggesting some possibility of a shared response.
  These findings support the utility of the microbiota as a pre-clinical tool for
  identifying exposures to specific heavy metals. It is also clear that characterizing
  changes to the functional capabilities of microbiota is critical to understanding
  responses to metal exposure.
