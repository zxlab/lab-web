 abstract = {Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion is one of the most common approaches to modulate the&nbsp;gut microbiome. Here the authors demonstrate that it affects gut homeostasis and glucose metabolism by decreasing luminal short chain fatty acids and leading to a shift of energy utilization by colonocytes.},
