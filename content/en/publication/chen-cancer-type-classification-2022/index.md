abstract: The utility of cell-free nucleic acids in monitoring cancer has been recognized
  by both scientists and clinicians. In addition to human transcripts, a fraction
  of cell-free nucleic acids in human plasma were proven to be derived from microbes
  and reported to have relevance to cancer. To obtain a better understanding of plasma
  cell-free RNAs (cfRNAs) in cancer patients, we profiled cfRNAs in ~ 300 plasma samples
  of 5 cancer types (colorectal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer,
  and esophageal cancer) and healthy donors (HDs) with RNA-seq. Microbe-derived cfRNAs
  were consistently detected by different computational methods when potential contaminations
  were carefully filtered. Clinically relevant signals were identified from human
  and microbial reads, and enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways
  of downregulated human genes and higher prevalence torque teno viruses both suggest
  that a fraction of cancer patients were immunosuppressed. Our data support the diagnostic
  value of human and microbe-derived plasma cfRNAs for cancer detection, as an area
  under the ROC curve of approximately 0.9 for distinguishing cancer patients from
  HDs was achieved. Moreover, human and microbial cfRNAs both have cancer type specificity,
  and combining two types of features could distinguish tumors of five different primary
  locations with an average recall of 60.4%. Compared to using human features alone,
  adding microbial features improved the average recall by approximately 8%. In summary,
  this work provides evidence for the clinical relevance of human and microbe-derived
  plasma cfRNAs and their potential utilities in cancer detection as well as the determination
  of tumor sites.
