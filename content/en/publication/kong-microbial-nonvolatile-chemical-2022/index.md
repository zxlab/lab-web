abstract: Understanding the microbial and chemical diversities, as well as what affects
  these diversities, is important for modern manufacturing of traditional fermented
  foods. In this work, Chinese dark teas (CDTs) that are traditional microbial fermented
  beverages with relatively high sample diversity were collected. Microbial DNA amplicon
  sequencing and mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics show that the CDT
  microbial $β$ diversity, as well as the nonvolatile chemical $α$ and $β$ diversities,
  is determined by the primary impact factors of geography and manufacturing procedures,
  in particular, latitude and pile fermentation after blending. A large number of
  metabolites sharing between CDTs and fungi were discovered by Feature-based Molecular
  Networking (FBMN) on the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS)
  web platform. These molecules, such as prenylated cyclic dipeptides and B-vitamins,
  are functionally important for nutrition, biofunctions, and flavor. Molecular networking
  has revealed patterns in metabolite profiles on a chemical family level in addition
  to individual structures.
