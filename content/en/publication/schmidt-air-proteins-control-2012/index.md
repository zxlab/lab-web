abstract: RNA surveillance systems function at critical steps during the formation
  and function of RNA molecules in all organisms. The RNA exosome plays a central
  role in RNA surveillance by processing and degrading RNA molecules in the nucleus
  and cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The exosome functions as a complex of proteins
  composed of a nine-member core and two ribonucleases. The identity of the molecular
  determinants of exosome RNA substrate specificity remains an important unsolved
  aspect of RNA surveillance. In the nucleus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TRAMP complexes
  recognize and polyadenylate RNAs, which enhances RNA degradation by the exosome
  and may contribute to its specificity. TRAMPs contain either of two putative RNA-binding
  factors called Air proteins. Previous studies suggested that these proteins function
  interchangeably in targeting the poly(A)-polymerase activity of TRAMPs to RNAs.
  Experiments reported here show that the Air proteins govern separable functions.
  Phenotypic analysis and RNA deep-sequencing results from air mutants reveal specific
  requirements for each Air protein in the regulation of the levels of noncoding and
  coding RNAs. Loss of these regulatory functions results in specific metabolic and
  plasmid inheritance defects. These findings reveal differential functions for Air
  proteins in RNA metabolism and indicate that they control the substrate specificity
  of the RNA exosome.
