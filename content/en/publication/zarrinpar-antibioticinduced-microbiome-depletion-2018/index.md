abstract: Antibiotic-induced microbiome depletion is one of the most common approaches
  to modulate the&nbsp;gut microbiome. Here the authors demonstrate that it affects
  gut homeostasis and glucose metabolism by decreasing luminal short chain fatty acids
  and leading to a shift of energy utilization by colonocytes.
