abstract: Abstract Microbes can be used effectively as trace evidence, at least in
  research settings. However, it is unknown whether skin microbiomes change prior
  to autopsy and, if so, whether these changes interfere with linking objects to decedents.
  The current study included microbiomes from 16 scenes of death in the City and County
  of Honolulu and tested whether objects at the scenes can be linked to individual
  decedents. Postmortem skin microbiomes were stable during repeated sampling up to
  60 h postmortem and were similar to microbiomes of an antemortem population. Objects
  could be traced to decedents approximately 75% of the time, with smoking pipes and
  medical devices being especially accurate (100% match), house and car keys being
  poor (0%), and other objects like phones intermediate (~ 80%). These results show
  that microbes from objects at death scenes can be matched to individual decedents,
  opening up a new method of establishing associations and identifications.
