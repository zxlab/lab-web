abstract: Accumulating evidence shows that the gastric bacterial community may contribute
  to the development of gastric cancer (GC). However, the reported alterations of
  gastric microbiota were not always consistent among the literature. To assess reproducible
  signals in gastric microbiota during the progression of GC across studies, we performed
  a meta-analysis of nine publicly available 16S datasets with standard tools of the
  state-of-the-art. Despite study-specific batch effect, significant changes in the
  composition of the gastric microbiome were found during the progression of gastric
  carcinogenesis, especially when the Helicobacter pylori (HP) reads were removed
  from analyses to mitigate its compositional effect as they accounted for extremely
  large proportions of sequencing depths in many gastric samples. Differential microbes,
  including Fusobacterium, Leptotrichia, and several lactic acid bacteria such as
  Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, and Streptococcus anginosus, which were frequently
  and significantly enriched in GC patients compared with gastritis across studies,
  had good discriminatory capacity to distinguish GC samples from gastritis. Oral
  microbes were significantly enriched in GC compared to precancerous stages. Intriguingly,
  we observed mutual exclusivity of different HP species across studies. In addition,
  the comparison between gastric fluid and mucosal microbiome suggested their convergent
  dysbiosis during gastric disease progression. Taken together, our systematic analysis
  identified novel and consistent microbial patterns in gastric carcinogenesis.
