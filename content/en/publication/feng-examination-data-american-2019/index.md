abstract: Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus are beneficial for human health, and many
  strains of these two genera are widely used as probiotics. We used two large datasets
  published by the American Gut Project (AGP) and a gut metagenomic dataset (NBT)
  to analyze the relationship between these two genera and the community structure
  of the gut microbiota. The meta-analysis showed that Bifidobacterium, but not Lactobacillus,
  is among the dominant genera in the human gut microbiota. The relative abundance
  of Bifidobacterium was elevated when Lactobacillus was present. Moreover, these
  two genera showed a positive correlation with some butyrate producers among the
  dominant genera, and both were associated with alpha diversity, beta diversity,
  and the robustness of the gut microbiota. Additionally, samples harboring Bifidobacterium
  present but no Lactobacillus showed higher alpha diversity and were more robust
  than those only carrying Lactobacillus. Further comparisons with other genera validated
  the important role of Bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota robustness. Multivariate
  analysis of 11,744 samples from the AGP dataset suggested Bifidobacterium to be
  associated with demographic features, lifestyle, and disease. In summary, Bifidobacterium
  members, which are promoted by dairy and whole-grain consumption, are more important
  than Lactobacillus in maintaining the diversity and robustness of the gut microbiota.
