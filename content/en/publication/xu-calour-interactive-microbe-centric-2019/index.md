abstract: Microbiome analyses can be challenging because microbial strains are numerous,
  and often, confounding factors in the data set are also numerous. Many tools reduce,
  summarize, and visualize these high-dimensional data to provide insight at the community
  level. However, they lose the detailed information about each taxon and can be misleading
  (for example, the well-known horseshoe effect in ordination plots). Thus, multiple
  methods at different levels of resolution are required to capture the full range
  of microbial patterns. Here we present Calour, a user-friendly data exploration
  tool for microbiome analyses. Calour provides a study-centric data model to store
  and manipulate sample-by-feature tables (with features typically being operational
  taxonomic units) and their associated metadata. It generates an interactive heatmap,
  allowing visualization of microbial patterns and exploration using microbial knowledge
  databases. We demonstrate the use of Calour by exploring publicly available data
  sets, including the gut and skin microbiota of habitat-switched fire salamander
  larvae, gut microbiota of Trichuris muris-infected mice, skin microbiota of different
  human body sites, gut microbiota of various ant species, and a metabolome study
  of mice exposed to intermittent hypoxia and hypercapnia. In these cases, Calour
  reveals novel patterns and potential contaminants of subgroups of microbes that
  are otherwise hard to find. Calour is open source under the Berkeley Software Distribution
  (BSD) license and available from https://github.com/biocore/calour. IMPORTANCE Calour
  allows us to identify interesting microbial patterns and generate novel biological
  hypotheses by interactively inspecting microbiome studies and incorporating annotation
  databases and convenient statistical tools. Calour can be used as a first-step tool
  for microbiome data exploration.
