abstract: Imagine a scenario where personal belongings such as pens, keys, phones,
  or handbags are found at an investigative site. It is often valuable to the investigative
  team that is trying to trace back the belongings to an individual to understand
  their personal habits, even when DNA evidence is also available. Here, we develop
  an approach to translate chemistries recovered from personal objects such as phones
  into a lifestyle sketch of the owner, using mass spectrometry and informatics approaches.
  Our results show that phones' chemistries reflect a personalized lifestyle profile.
  The collective repertoire of molecules found on these objects provides a sketch
  of the lifestyle of an individual by highlighting the type of hygiene/beauty products
  the person uses, diet, medical status, and even the location where this person may
  have been. These findings introduce an additional form of trace evidence from skin-associated
  lifestyle chemicals found on personal belongings. Such information could help a
  criminal investigator narrowing down the owner of an object found at a crime scene,
  such as a suspect or missing person.
