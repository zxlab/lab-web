abstract: Development of cirrhosis in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
  can predict mortality. Here the authors used a unique twin and family cohort to
  identify a gut microbiome-derived 16sRNA signature that can detect cirrhosis in
  individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
