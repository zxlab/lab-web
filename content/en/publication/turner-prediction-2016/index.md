abstract: "RNA structure is conserved by evolution to a greater extent than sequence. Predicting the conserved structure for multiple homologous sequences can be much more accurate than predicting the structure for a single sequence. RNAstructure is a software package that includes the programs Dynalign, Multilign, TurboFold, and PARTS for predicting conserved RNA secondary structure. This chapter provides protocols for using these programs."
