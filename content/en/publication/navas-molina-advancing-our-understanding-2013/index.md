abstract: Abstract High-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, coupled with advanced
  bioinformatics tools, have enabled rapid advances in microbial ecology and our understanding
  of the human microbiome. QIIME (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) is
  an open-source bioinformatics software package designed for microbial community
  analysis based on DNA sequence data, which provides a single analysis framework
  for analysis of raw sequence data through publication-quality statistical analyses
  and interactive visualizations. In this chapter, we demonstrate the use of the QIIME
  pipeline to analyze microbial communities obtained from several sites on the bodies
  of transgenic and wild-type mice, as assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequences generated
  on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We present our recommended pipeline for performing
  microbial community analysis and provide guidelines for making critical choices
  in the process. We present examples of some of the types of analyses that are enabled
  by QIIME and discuss how other tools, such as phyloseq and R, can be applied to
  expand upon these analyses.
