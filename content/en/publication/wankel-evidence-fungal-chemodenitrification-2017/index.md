abstract: $<$p$>$Predicting nitrous oxide emissions (Ntextsubscript2O) remains difficult
  due to the numerous Ntextsubscript2O production pathways. Here, the authors use
  incubations simulating high nitrate inputs to show that, in intertidal sediments,
  increases in Ntextsubscript2O flux are large&hellip;$<$/p$>$
