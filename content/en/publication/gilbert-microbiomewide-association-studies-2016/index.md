abstract: Rapid advances in DNA sequencing, metabolomics, proteomics and computational
  tools are dramatically increasing access to the microbiome and identification of
  its links with disease. In particular, time-series studies and multiple molecular
  perspectives are facilitating microbiome-wide association studies, which are analogous
  to genome-wide association studies. Early findings point to actionable outcomes
  of microbiome-wide association studies, although their clinical application has
  yet to be approved. An appreciation of the complexity of interactions among the
  microbiome and the host's diet, chemistry and health, as well as determining the
  frequency of observations that are needed to capture and integrate this dynamic
  interface, is paramount for developing precision diagnostics and therapies that
  are based on the microbiome.
