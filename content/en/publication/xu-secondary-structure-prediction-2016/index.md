abstract: RNA secondary structure is often predicted using folding thermodynamics.
  RNAstructure is a software package that includes structure prediction by free energy
  minimization, prediction of base pairing probabilities, prediction of structures
  composed of highly probably base pairs, and prediction of structures with pseudoknots.
  A user-friendly graphical user interface is provided, and this interface works on
  Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux. This chapter provides protocols for using RNAstructure
  for structure prediction.
