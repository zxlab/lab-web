 abstract = {RNA secondary structure is often predicted using folding thermodynamics. RNAstructure is a software package that includes structure prediction by free energy minimization, prediction of base pairing probabilities, prediction of structures composed of highly probably base pairs, and prediction of structures with pseudoknots. A user-friendly graphical user interface is provided, and this interface works on Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux. This chapter provides protocols for using RNAstructure for structure prediction.},
