abstract: The oral microbiome is linked to oral and systemic health, but its fluctuation
  under frequent daily activities remains elusive. Here, we sampled saliva at 10-
  to 60-min intervals to track the high-resolution microbiome dynamics during the
  course of human activities. This dense time series data showed that eating activity
  markedly perturbed the salivary microbiota, with tongue-specific Campylobacter concisus
  and Oribacterium sinus and dental plaque-specific Lautropia mirabilis, Rothia aeria,
  and Neisseria oralis increased after every meal in a temporal order. The observation
  was reproducible in multiple subjects and across an 11-mo period. The microbiome
  composition showed significant diurnal oscillation patterns at different taxonomy
  levels with Prevotella/Alloprevotella increased at night and Bergeyella HMT 206/Haemophilus
  slowly increased during the daytime. We also identified microbial co-occurring patterns
  in saliva that are associated with the intricate biogeography of the oral microbiome.
  Microbial source tracking analysis showed that the contributions of distinct oral
  niches to the salivary microbiome were dynamically affected by daily activities,
  reflecting the role of saliva in exchanging microbes with other oral sites. Collectively,
  our study provides insights into the temporal microbiome variation in saliva and
  highlights the need to consider daily activities and diurnal factors in design of
  oral microbiome studies.
