abstract: 'Disruption of healthy microbial communities has been linked to numerous
  diseases, yet microbial interactions are little understood. This is due in part
  to the large number of bacteria, and the much larger number of interactions (easily
  in the millions), making experimental investigation very difficult at best and necessitating
  the nascent field of computational exploration through microbial correlation networks.
  We benchmark the performance of eight correlation techniques on simulated and real
  data in response to challenges specific to microbiome studies: fractional sampling
  of ribosomal RNA sequences, uneven sampling depths, rare microbes and a high proportion
  of zero counts. Also tested is the ability to distinguish signals from noise, and
  detect a range of ecological and time-series relationships. Finally, we provide
  specific recommendations for correlation technique usage. Although some methods
  perform better than others, there is still considerable need for improvement in
  current techniques.'
