abstract: Microbes are present at every crime scene and have been used as physical
  evidence for over a century. Advances in DNA sequencing and computational approaches
  have led to recent breakthroughs in the use of microbiome approaches for forensic
  science, particularly in the areas of estimating postmortem intervals (PMIs), locating
  clandestine graves, and obtaining soil and skin trace evidence. Low-cost, high-throughput
  technologies allow us to accumulate molecular data quickly and to apply sophisticated
  machine-learning algorithms, building generalizable predictive models that will
  be useful in the criminal justice system. In particular, integrating microbiome
  and metabolomic data has excellent potential to advance microbial forensics.
