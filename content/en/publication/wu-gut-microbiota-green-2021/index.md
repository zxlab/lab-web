abstract: Alteration of the gut microbiota may contribute to the development of inflammatory
  bowel disease (IBD). Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major bioactive constituent
  of green tea, is known to be beneficial in IBD alleviation. However, it is unclear
  whether the gut microbiota exerts an~effect when EGCG attenuates IBD.
