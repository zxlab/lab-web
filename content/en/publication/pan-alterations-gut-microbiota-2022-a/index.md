abstract: The gut microbiota is involved in host responses to high altitude. However,
  the dynamics of intestinal microecology and their association with altitude-related
  illness are poorly understood. Here, we used a rat model of hypobaric hypoxia challenge
  to mimic plateau exposure and monitored the gut microbiome, short-chain fatty acids
  (SCFAs), and bile acids (BAs) over 28 d. We identified weight loss, polycythemia,
  and pathological cardiac hypertrophy in hypoxic rats, accompanied by a large compositional
  shift in the gut microbiota, which is mainly driven by the bacterial families of
  Prevotellaceae, Porphyromonadaceae, and Streptococcaceae. The aberrant gut microbiota
  was characterized by increased abundance of the Parabacteroides, Alistipes, and
  Lactococcus genera and a larger Bacteroides to Prevotella ratio. Trans-omics analyses
  showed that the gut microbiome was significantly correlated with the metabolic abnormalities
  of SCFAs and BAs in feces, suggesting an interaction network remodeling of the microbiome-metabolome
  after the hypobaric hypoxia challenge. Interestingly, the transplantation of fecal
  microbiota significantly increased the diversity of the gut microbiota, partially
  inhibited the increased abundance of the Bacteroides and Alistipes genera, restored
  the decrease of plasma propionate, and moderately ameliorated cardiac hypertrophy
  in hypoxic rats. Our results provide an insight into the longitudinal changes in
  intestinal microecology during the hypobaric hypoxia challenge. Abnormalities in
  the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites contribute to the development of high-altitude
  heart disease in rats.
