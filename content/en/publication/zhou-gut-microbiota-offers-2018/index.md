abstract: $<$h3$>$ABSTRACT$<$/h3$>$ $<$p$>$Gut microbiota dysbiosis contributes to
  the onset and perpetuation of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Given that gut microbiotas
  vary across geography and ethnicity, it remains obscure whether any universal microbial
  signatures for IBD diagnosis and prognosis evaluation exist irrespective of populations.
  Here we profiled the fecal microbiota of a series of Chinese IBD patients and combined
  them with two Western IBD cohorts, PRISM and RISK, for meta-analyses. We found that
  the gut microbial alteration patterns in IBD are similar among Chinese and Westerners.
  Our prediction model based on gut microbiome for IBD diagnosis is robust across
  the cohorts, which showed 87.5% and 79.1% prediction accuracy in Crohn's disease
  (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, respectively. A relative increase in
  the levels of emphActinobacteria and emphProteobacteria (emphEnterobacteriaceae)
  and a relative decrease in the levels of emphFirmicutes (emphClostridiales) were
  strongly correlated with IBD severity (emphP &lt; 0.05). Additionally, restoration
  of gut microbiota diversity and a significant increase in emphClostridiales relative
  abundance were found in patients responding to infliximab (IFX [Remicade]) treatment
  compared to those in relapse. Moreover, certain microbes, mainly emphClostridiales,
  predicted the treatment effectiveness with 86.5% accuracy alone and 93.8% accuracy
  in combination with calprotectin levels and Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI).
  Taking the results together, we conclude that gut microbiota can offer a set of
  universal biomarkers for diagnosis, disease activity evaluation, and infliximab
  treatment response prediction in IBD.$<$/p$><$p$>$textbfIMPORTANCE In the present
  report, we show that the human fecal microbiota contains promising and universal
  biomarkers for the noninvasive evaluation of inflammatory bowel disease severity
  and IFX treatment efficacy, emphasizing the potential ability to mine the gut microbiota
  as a modality to stratify IBD patients and apply personalized therapy for optimal
  outcomes.$<$/p$>$
