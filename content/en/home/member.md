# description = "I am a rising junior at Minerva Schools at KGI majoring in computer science with double concentrations in AI and data science, and minoring in cognitive psychology. I am curious about how the human mind constructs causal models to understand the world, and to what extent machines can learn and adapt to this incredible ability. I love all sorts of tea (and # boba, of course!)."

One of my interests is how causal and normative judgments are affected by the social contexts in which they are made. I also like to study causal and social cognition from a developmental perspective. I enjoy drinking coffee."

#	description = "I am a psychology PhD student at University College London (UCL) with [Prof. David Lagnado](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/index.html) and currently visiting the Causality in Cognition Lab. My PhD research investigates how “soft” factors, e.g. the norm-related features of a causal context, change the way we think about the cause of an event, and whether (and, if so, to what extent) counterfactual theories of causation can capture this. I enjoy eating chocolate."
